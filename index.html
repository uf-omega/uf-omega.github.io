            <p>UNDERFELL OMEGA is an UNDERTALE fangame created out of the idea that UNDERFELL takes in general change characters completely, removing all sense of morality.</p>
            <p>I'm not saying this is bad or <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">ruins</a> every take- Look at Fella's original concept, it's great- I just like how recent fangames try to stay close to those original characterizations, and figured UNDERFELL could use a douse of that as well.</p>
            <p>Of course, this is much easier <em>said</em> than <em>done</em>- UNDERFELL is famous for the so-called "edgy" versions of UNDERTALE characters, not so much the clever ideology behind it.</p>
            <p>Which in this case would be thee idea to make UNDERTALE truer to classic RPGs.</p>
            <p>So to do this, I incorporated a few linear role-changes in the fashion of UNDERSWAP, STORYSHIFT, STORYSPIN, etc etc etc... With a ton of non-linear role changes and original roles, plus new characters and a completely different mountain to fall under.</p>
            <p>Oh yeah, and a completely reworked storyline that throws you more screwballs than I have time to count at the present moment.</p>
            <p>The current plan is to release tracks on the SoundCloud account while continuing the game's development in the background.</p>
            <p>As the game progresses, I'll add to this website with new information, and a new design as well, because as you can see it's...</p>
            <p>A bit <em>raw</em> right now.</p>
