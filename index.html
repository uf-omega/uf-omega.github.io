            <p>UNDERFELL OMEGA is an UNDERTALE fangame that strives to be both canon-accurate and unique.</p>
            <p>Of course, this is much easier <em>said</em> than <em>done</em>- UNDERFELL is famous for the so-called "edgy" versions of UNDERTALE characters, and changing this would ruin the whole point.</p>
            <p>As such, this take focuses swapping <em>concepts</em> like UNDERFELL was originally intended to do.</p>
            <p>Even so, most characters will be in different roles and new characters will be added to complement them. And there's... what, four new areas? Well, that, and there's a completely reworked storyline to fit with the whole concept-swapping thing.</p>
            <p>The current plan is to release tracks on the SoundCloud account while continuing the game's development in the background.</p>
            <p>As the game progresses, I'll add to this website with new information, and a new design as well, because as you can see it's...</p>
            <p>A bit <em>raw</em> right now.</p>
