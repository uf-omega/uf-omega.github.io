        <p>UNDERTALE has gotten a surge in super creative fan takes and AUs recently.</p>
        <p>A few examples being <a href="https://teamswitched.dev/">TS!UNDERSWAP</a>, 
        <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/UndertaleYellow/136925">Undertale Yellow</a>, and even 
        <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/Swapfeller/778349">SwApFell I hate you</a>.</p>
        <p>However, it is becoming increasingly apparent to me just how quickly it is dying back down.</p>
        <p>As such, I figured this was the perfect time to create a SoundCloud Account and design a gigantic UNDERFELL take inspired by <a href="https://invertedfate.com/">Inverted Fate</a> with a semi-original storyline and non-linear role changes.</p>
        <p>The current plan is to release tracks on the SoundCloud account while continuing the game's development in the background.</p>
        <p>As the game progresses, I'll add to this website with new information.</p>
